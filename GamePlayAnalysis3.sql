Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0)
 before logging out on some day using some device.
 

Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. 
That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 1         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| player_id | event_date | games_played_so_far |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5                   |
| 1         | 2016-05-02 | 11                  |
| 1         | 2017-06-25 | 12                  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02 | 0                   |
| 3         | 2018-07-03 | 5                   |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.

select a1.player_id, a1.event_date, sum(a2.games_played) as games_played_so_far
from activity as a1
inner join activity as a2
on a1.event_date >= a2.event_date
and a1.player_id = a2.player_id
group by  a1.player_id, a1.event_date


--Method 1: Using Self Join (fastest solution of all the 3)

SELECT a1.player_id, a1.event_date,
SUM(a2.games_played) AS games_played_so_far
FROM activity a1, activity a2
WHERE a1.player_id = a2.player_id
AND a1.event_date >=a2.event_date
GROUP BY a1.player_id, a1.event_date
ORDER BY a1.player_id, a1.event_date;
--Method 2: Using window functions

SELECT
player_id, event_date, sum(games_played) over(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date)
AS 'games_played_so_far'
FROM activity
ORDER BY player_id, games_played_so_far;
--Method 3: Using correlated sub query

 SELECT a1.player_id, a1.event_date,
 (SELECT sum(a2.games_played) FROM activity a2
 WHERE a1.player_id = a2.player_id AND a1.event_date >=a2.event_date
 GROUP BY a1.player_id)
 AS games_played_so_far
 FROM activity a1 ORDER BY a1.player_id, games_played_so_far;
 
 
 
 MySQL. Self-join. Calculate cumsum (running sum). No Window function.

 Write your MySQL query statement below
 
select a1.player_id, a1.event_date, sum(a2.games_played) as games_played_so_far
from Activity a1, Activity a2
where a1.player_id = a2.player_id and a2.event_date <= a1.event_date
group by a1.player_id, a1.event_date
order by a1.player_id, a1.event_date
;

Please make sure the inequity is a2.event_date <= a1.event_date. Think in this way: 
a2 is the table you want to use to carry the running sum, so you have to constrain it in
 the range you want to sum.
