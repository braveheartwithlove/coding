Since we need information from both tables for every result, we use an inner join (which in MSSQL can be written as just JOIN). Remember when using BETWEEN that it's inclusive of the end date if you don't specify a time.

SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM TVProgram p
JOIN Content c ON p.content_id = c.content_id
WHERE
    program_date BETWEEN '6/1/2020' AND '6/30/2020'
AND Kids_content = 'Y'
AND content_type = 'Movies'	
	
select distinct c.title 
from content c, tvprogram tv 
where tv.content_id = c.content_id
and (tv.program_date) like '2020-06%'
and c.kids_content = 'Y'
and c.content_type='Movies'


select distinct c.title from Content c left join TVProgram t
on c.content_id=t.content_id where c.Kids_content='Y' and content_type='Movies'
and FORMAT(t.program_date,'yyyy-MM')='2020-06'
